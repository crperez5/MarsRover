# MarsRover (Version: 1.2)



# What is MarsRover?

MarsRover is a small command-line application that translates the commands sent from earth to actions executed by the rover yielding a final state.
When the rover touches down on Mars, it is initialised with its current coordinates and the direction it is facing. These could be any coordinates, supplied as arguments (x, y, direction) e.g. (4,
2, EAST).
The rover is given a command string which contains multiple commands. This string must then be broken into each individual command and that command then executed. Implement the following
command: 
F -> Move forward on current heading
An example command might be FFF
Once the full command string has been followed, the rover reports it's current coordinates and heading e.g. (7, 2) EAST.
